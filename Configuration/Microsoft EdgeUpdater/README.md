## Managing EdgeUpdater Settings

Unless I'm missing it, Microsoft has not yet added Settings Catalog configuration for managing [EdgeUpdater](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-edgeupdater-policies-mac). If you would like to manage it, the preference file here is an example of how to configure it. (Surprise, it is managed very similar to the Google Keystone updater for Chrome.)
