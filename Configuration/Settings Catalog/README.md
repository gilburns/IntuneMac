## Managing Settings Catalog configuration  

Settings Catalog settings can be managed in Intune using the **Settings Catalog** configuration.  

### Create new Settings Catalog configuration:  
Click the **Create** -> **New Policy** button.   

* For Profile type, select **Settings Catalog**. Then click the **Create** button.  
* Name your profile using a preferred naming standard and then click **Next**.  
* Click the **Add settings** button, to find the setting you desire to manage.  
* Confirm all your settings are present, then click the **Next** button.  
* Assign the profile to your appropriate device or user group.  
  
### Import Settings Catalog configuration:  
Click the **Create** -> **Import Policy** button.   

* Click **Browse for files**, or drag the json file to the drop zone.
* Name your profile using a preferred naming standard and optionally provide a description, then click **Save**.  
* Once it is saved, you then have the option to **View policy** or **close** the import panel.  
* Your policy is not scoped by default. You should review the newly imported policy and make sure the settings match what you expect.
* When you are satisfied with the settings, assign the profile to your appropriate device or user group.
